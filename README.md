# ITERATIONS-IN-PYTHON

# I Finally Understand Iterations in Python 

This notebook marks a key milestone in my Python learning journey: **grasping iterations**.

I used to struggle with understanding how to loop through data. But this week, it finally clicked.

## What I Practiced:
- Looping through `lists`
- Iterating over `strings`, `tuples`, `ranges`, and `dictionaries`
- Writing `for` loops in beginner-friendly, real-world examples

## Sample Code That Helped Me:
```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
for color in colors:
    print(color)
